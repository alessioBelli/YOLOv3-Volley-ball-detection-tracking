# :page_with_curl: Description
This repository shows how you can perform ball detection and tracking during a volleyball match using YOLOv3. We perform fine-tune in order to adapt the original weights of YOLOv3 in order to best recognize the ball. 
This process is is carried out using approximately 3000 frames of volleyball matches found on youtube.
